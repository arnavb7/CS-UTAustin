Analysis:
We discovered that text-based files often result in a large percent compression rate, averaging
around a 40% compression rate. Image files such as jpeg or tif files often get much less
compression, anywhere from a 5% to 18% compression rate. In addition, attempting to compress files
that have already been compressed through Huffman coding leads to little or no compression as these
files are already compressed, so further compression is low, averaging around a 1% compression rate.
